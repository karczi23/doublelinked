`NEXT`  
_forwards current position to next node. if it's the end of the list, the first node on the list becomes **current**_

`DEL_END`  
_deletes the node at the end of the list_

`PRINT_FORWARD`  
_prints all data stored inside the nodes from **the start to the end**_

`PRINT_BACKWARD`  
_prints all data stored inside the nodes from **the end to the start**_
